"""
Comprehensive Test Suite for WorkConnect Job Posting Notification System.

Verifies:
1. Database schema and migration for notifications table
2. Employer successfully posts a job and notification is triggered
3. Registered workers receive the notification with job title, company name, location, and time
4. Deduplication: duplicate notifications are prevented for the same job event
5. Reverse chronological ordering of notifications (newest first)
6. Worker dashboard renders notification bell icon, unread count badge, and dropdown panel
7. Job details page (/jobs/<id>) renders correct job information
8. Opening job with ?notif_id=<id> marks notification as read
9. API endpoint /api/notifications/read/<id> marks notification as read and updates count
10. API endpoint /api/notifications/read-all marks all notifications as read and resets count to 0
11. Empty state verification when user has no notifications
